# Network Port Scanner - Features & Usage

## Overview
A comprehensive web-based Network Port Scanner built for educational purposes and cybersecurity awareness. This application demonstrates port scanning concepts, vulnerability detection, and network security principles.

## Key Features

### 1. Port Scanning Engine
- **Socket-based scanning simulation** that tests port connectivity
- **Multi-threaded scanning** for improved performance
- **Real-time progress tracking** with live updates
- **Port status detection**: Open, Closed, or Filtered
- **Service identification** for common ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, MySQL, etc.)

### 2. User Interface
- **Scan Configuration Form**
  - Target IP/Hostname input
  - Port range selection (start and end port)
  - Input validation and error handling

- **Real-time Progress Display**
  - Current port being scanned
  - Progress bar with percentage
  - Live counters for open/closed/filtered ports
  - Ability to cancel ongoing scans

- **Comprehensive Results View**
  - Categorized results by port status
  - Service names for known ports
  - Scan duration for each port
  - Visual indicators with color coding

### 3. Database Integration (Supabase)
- **Scan Sessions Table**: Stores complete scan metadata
  - Target IP, port range, timestamps
  - Total counts of open/closed/filtered ports
  - Scan status tracking

- **Scan Results Table**: Detailed port-level data
  - Individual port status
  - Service identification
  - Scan timing information

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Proper security policies implemented

### 4. Historical Records
- **Scan History Panel**
  - View past scan sessions
  - Quick access to previous results
  - Delete old scan records
  - Sortable by date and target

### 5. Educational Information
- **Info Panel** explaining:
  - What port scanning is
  - Port status types (open/closed/filtered)
  - Common ports and their services
  - Ethical considerations and legal warnings

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Components
1. **User Input Module** - Form validation and parameter collection
2. **Scanning Engine** - Socket programming simulation with threading
3. **Result Analyzer** - Categorizes and processes scan results
4. **Database Logger** - Stores results in Supabase PostgreSQL
5. **Report Generator** - Visual display of scan results
6. **Historical Data Manager** - Retrieves and manages past scans

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients

### Security Features
- Input validation for IP addresses and port ranges
- Port range limits (max 10,000 ports per scan)
- Educational warnings about authorization
- Simulated scanning (browser-safe implementation)

## How to Use

### Starting a Scan
1. Enter target IP address or hostname
2. Set start port (0-65535)
3. Set end port (0-65535)
4. Click "Start Scan"

### During Scan
- Watch real-time progress
- Monitor open/closed/filtered port counts
- Cancel scan if needed

### Viewing Results
- Results display automatically after scan completes
- See detailed breakdown of all scanned ports
- Open ports highlighted with service names
- Access results from history panel

### Managing History
- View all past scans in history panel
- Click "View Results" to see details
- Delete old scans to clean up database

## Educational Value

This tool demonstrates:
- **Port scanning concepts** and methodologies
- **Network security principles** and vulnerabilities
- **Database design** for logging and analysis
- **Real-time UI updates** and progress tracking
- **Cybersecurity ethics** and responsible disclosure

## Important Notes

- This is an **educational tool** for learning purposes
- **Always obtain authorization** before scanning any network
- **Unauthorized scanning** may be illegal in your jurisdiction
- The tool uses **simulated scanning** for demonstration
- Not intended for production security auditing

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
- Export scan results to PDF/CSV
- Advanced filtering and search
- Comparison between multiple scans
- Scheduled periodic scans
- Email notifications for completed scans
- Integration with vulnerability databases
